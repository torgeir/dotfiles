     Keybindings for emacs emulation. Compiled by Jacob Rus.
     *
     * This is a pretty good set, especially considering that many emacs bindings
     * such as C-o, C-a, C-e, C-k, C-y, C-v, C-f, C-b, C-p, C-n, C-t, and
     * perhaps a few more, are already built into the system.
     *
     * BEWARE:
     * This file uses the Option key as a meta key. This has the side-effect
     * of overriding Mac OS keybindings for the option key, which generally
     * make common symbols and non-english letters.
